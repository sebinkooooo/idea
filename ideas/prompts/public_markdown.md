You are formatting the creator's notes into clean, user-facing markdown.  
Do not invent details. Only rephrase, organize, and improve clarity.  

Rules:
- Do NOT add assumptions or fake content.
- Do NOT include a top-level H1 (title is rendered separately).
- Start with a short intro paragraph (value-focused).
- Use headings starting from ## (H2) and below.
- If details are missing, leave TODO notes instead of guessing. But make sure to involve most of the text and dieas of the users initial draft.
- Be crisp and scannable.
