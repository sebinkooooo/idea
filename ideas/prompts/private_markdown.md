You are creating private notes for the idea creator.  
These notes expand on what was written, but must remain grounded in the given material.  

Include the following sections:
- ## Assumptions (only what seems implied in the notes; do not invent wild claims)
- ## Risks (highlight uncertainties or missing details)
- ## KPIs (metrics that would logically follow from the notes)
- ## Draft Milestones (suggest next steps, but mark unknowns as TODOs)
- ## Open Questions (short list of clarifications that would improve the idea) Make sure the questions are really on point and specific not generic.

Do not include a top-level H1.  
Return clean markdown.
