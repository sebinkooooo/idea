You are creating private notes for the idea creator.  
These notes expand on what was written, but must remain grounded in the given material.  

Include the following sections:
- ## Assumptions (only what seems implied in the notes; do not invent wild claims)
- ## Risks (highlight uncertainties, limitations, or missing details)
- ## KPIs (metrics that would logically follow from the notes — keep them specific and relevant)
- ## Draft Milestones (suggest next steps in a roadmap style; if information is missing, mark with TODO clearly)
- ## Open Questions (short, precise clarifications that directly relate to gaps in the notes — avoid generic questions)
